  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the practical application of several empirically-based, directional ocean wave spectra for use in the Fourier synthesis of animated ocean height fields. We use the Texel MARSEN ARSLOE (TMA) empirical model for the nondirectional component of the wave spectrum, and compare a selection of empirically-based directional spreading functions. Additionally, we introduce a novel, normalized parameter called ``swell'' which modifies the directional spreading to produce wavelengthdependent elongation of waves into parallel wave trains.},

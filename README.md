# Mohamed Tarek's Research Vault

This repository contains my research notebooks, design notes, and experiment logs for
projects related to real-time rendering, Vulkan, and procedural graphics systems.

## 🧠 Goals
- Develop an open research record in computer graphics and simulation.
- Reproduce, extend, and analyze key papers in real-time rendering.
- Document performance, data structures, and GPU-level implementation insights.
- And, honestly, just develop note-taking skills in research to member what I read more.
